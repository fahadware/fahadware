I'm Fahad — a Computer Science student at FAST-NUCES, just beginning my journey into the world of Full-Stack Web Development using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js).

Right now, I’m focused on building a strong foundation in:
- 🖥️ Frontend & Backend Development
- ⚙️ JavaScript, React, and Node.js
- 🗃️ Database management and RESTful APIs

 My Roadmap
I'm following a learning path that helps me grow step-by-step:
1. ✅ MERN Stack Development– Currently learning and building projects
2. 🔄 DevOps – Planning to explore automation, CI/CD, and cloud tools
3. 🤖 AI/ML– Future goal: dive into machine learning and intelligent systems
4. 
I aim to become a well-rounded developer with strong skills in both  software development and system infrastructure, eventually combining my technical knowledge with AI to solve real-world problems.

 Currently Exploring
- Frontend tools like React & Tailwind CSS
- Backend concepts with Node.js & Express
- Git, GitHub & version control for collaboration

 “Every expert was once a beginner.” — Taking one step at a time and enjoying the process.
